# Statement of need 

Convection-diffusion problems arise across a wide range of pure and applied research,
  in particular in geosciences, aerospace engineering, and financial modelling
  (for an overview of applications, see, e.g., section 1.1 in @Morton_1996).
One of the key challenges in numerical solutions of problems involving advective transport is
  sign preservation of the advected field (for an overview of this and other
  aspects of numerical solutions to advection problems, see, e.g., @Roed_2019).
The Multidimensional Positive Definite Advection Transport Algorithm (``MPDATA``) is a robust, 
  explicit-in-time, and sign-preserving solver introduced in @Smolarkiewicz_1983 and @Smolarkiewicz_1984.
``MPDATA`` has been subsequently developed into a family of numerical schemes with numerous variants 
  and solution procedures addressing a diverse set of problems in geophysical fluid dynamics and beyond.
For reviews of ``MPDATA`` applications and variants, see, e.g., @Smolarkiewicz_and_Margolin_1998_JCP and 
  @Smolarkiewicz_2006.
  
The ``PyMPDATA`` project introduced herein constitutes a high-performance and multi-threaded implementation of
  structured-mesh ``MPDATA`` in ``Python``.
``PyMPDATA`` is aimed to address several aspects which steepen the learning curve and limit collaborative 
  usage and development of existing ``C++`` [e.g., @Jaruga_et_al_2015] 
  and ``Fortran`` [e.g., @Kuehnlein_et_al_2019] implementations of ``MPDATA``.
Performance on par with compiled-language implementations is targeted by employing just-in-time (JIT) compilation
  using ``Numba`` [@Lam_et_al_2015], which translates ``Python`` code into fast machine code using the Low Level Virtual Machine (``LLVM``, https://llvm.org/)
  compiler infrastructure [for a discussion of another JIT implementation of ``MPDATA`` using ``PyPy``, see @Arabas_et_al_2014].
``PyMPDATA`` is engineered aiming at both performance and usability, the latter encompassing 
  research user's, developer's and maintainer's perspectives.
From researcher's perspective, ``PyMPDATA`` offers hassle-free installation on 
  ``Linux``, ``macOS``, and ``Windows``.
It also eliminates the compilation stage from the perspective of the user.
From developer's and maintainer's perspectives, ``PyMPDATA`` offers a suite of unit tests, multi-platform 
  continuous integration setup, seamless integration with ``Python`` development tools including debuggers, profilers,
  and code analysers.

# Summary

``PyMPDATA`` interface uses ``NumPy`` for array-oriented input and output. 
Usage of ``PyMPDATA`` from ``Julia`` (https://julialang.org) and ``Matlab`` (https://mathworks.com) 
  through ``PyCall`` and the built-in ``Python`` interoperability tools, respectively,
  is depicted in the PyMPDATA README file.
The appendices of the present paper include ``Python``, ``Julia`` and ``Matlab`` minimal 
  code snippets covering steps needed to complete a basic ``PyMPDATA`` simulation
  depicted in Fig. (\autoref{fig}) and based on Fig. 5 from @Arabas_et_al_2014.

As of the current version, ``PyMPDATA`` supports homogeneous transport in one (1D), two (2D), and three dimensions (3D) 
  using structured meshes, optionally generalised by coordinate transformation 
  [@Smolarkiewicz_and_Clark_1986;@Smolarkiewicz_and_Margolin_1993]. 
``PyMPDATA`` includes implementation of a subset of ``MPDATA`` variants, such as 
  the non-oscillatory option [@Smolarkiewicz_and_Grabowski_1990], 
  the infinite-gauge variant [@Smolarkiewicz_and_Clark_1986;@Margolin_and_Shashkov_2006], 
  the divergent-flow option [@Smolarkiewicz_1984;@Smolarkiewicz_and_Margolin_1998_SIAM],
  the double-pass donor cell (DPDC) flavour [@Beason_Margolin_1988;@Smolarkiewicz_and_Margolin_1998_SIAM;@Margolin_and_Shashkov_2006], and 
  the third-order-terms options [@Smolarkiewicz_and_Margolin_1998_SIAM]. 
It also features support for integration of Fickian-terms in advection-diffusion problems using 
  the pseudo-transport velocity approach [@Smolarkiewicz_and_Clark_1986;@Smolarkiewicz_and_Szmelter_2005]. 

A companion package named ``PyMPDATA-examples`` contains a set of Jupyter notebooks, which reproduce
  results from literature using ``PyMPDATA``.
These examples are also executed within continuous integration runs.
Several of the examples feature comparisons against analytical solution, and these are
  also included in the test suite of ``PyMPDATA``.
The ``PyMPDATA-examples`` README file includes links (badges) offering single-click deployment 
  in the cloud using either the Binder (``https://mybinder.org``) or the Colab (``https://colab.research.google.com``) platforms.

A separate project named ``numba-mpi`` has been developed to set the stage for future Message Passing Interface (``MPI``)
  distributed memory parallelism in ``PyMPDATA``.
The ``PyMPDATA``, the ``PyMPDATA-examples`` and the ``numba-mpi`` packages are available in the 
  ``PyPI`` package repository, and installation of these packages reduces to
  typing ``pip install package_name``.
Development of all three packages is hosted on ``GitHub`` at: https://github.com/atmos-cloud-sim-uj/
  and continuous integration runs on ``Linux``, ``macOS`` and ``Windows`` using
  ``GitHub Actions`` and ``Appveyor`` platforms (the latter used for 32-bit runs on Windows).
Auto-generated documentation sites built with ``pdoc3``  
are hosted at
  https://atmos-cloud-sim-uj.github.io/PyMPDATA/, 
  https://atmos-cloud-sim-uj.github.io/PyMPDATA-examples/, and 
  https://atmos-cloud-sim-uj.github.io/numba-mpi/.

# Implementation highlights

In 2D and 3D simulations, domain-decomposition is used for multi-threaded parallelism. 
Domain decomposition is performed along the outer dimension only and is realised using
  the ``numba.prange()`` functionality.

``PyMPDATA`` design features a custom-built multi-dimensional Arakawa-C staggered grid layer, allowing to concisely 
  represent multi-dimensional stencil operations on both scalar and vector fields. 
The grid layer is built on top of ``NumPy``'s ``ndarray``s (using "C" ordering) using the ``Numba``'s ``@njit`` 
  functionality for high-performance multi-threaded array traversals. 
The array-traversal layer enables to code once for multiple dimensions (i.e. one set of ``MPDATA`` formulae for 1D, 2D, and 3D), 
  and automatically handles (if needed) any halo-filling logic related to boundary conditions. 

The ``Numba``'s deviation from ``Python`` semantics rendering closure variables as compile-time constants 
  is extensively exploited within ``PyMPDATA`` code base enabling the just-in-time compilation to benefit
  from information on domain extents, algorithm variant used and problem characteristics (e.g., coordinate 
  transformation used, or lack thereof). 

In general, the numerical and concurrency aspects of ``PyMPDATA`` implementation follow the ``libmpdata++`` 
  open-source ``C++`` implementation of ``MPDATA`` [@Jaruga_et_al_2015].

# Performance

A basic performance analysis is carried out comparing ``PyMPDATA`` execution (wall) times: 
  (i) with or without Numba JIT, as well as (ii) comparing performance against the ``C++`` 
  implementation of ``MPDATA`` in ``libmpdata++``.
The tests are carried out using a 3D simulation based on the revolving sphere case from 
  @Smolarkiewicz_1984 (figs. 13-16 therein) as used in @Jaruga_et_al_2015 (fig. 13 therein).
The simulation setup involves solution of a homogeneous advection problem in a cubic domain
  with a non-divergent rotational flow.
Here, for simplicity, all simulations are carried out for 64 timesteps, and the measured
  wall-time is divided by the number of steps and reported as wall-time per timestep.
In all reported runs, both for libmpdata++ and PyMPDATA, two corrective iterations of MPDATA
  are used, and the basic flavour of the algorithm is employed.
Wall-time measurements are carried out using the build-in C++ timers in libmpdata++, and
  using Python's ``timeit`` routines, respectively.
Timing applies to integration only excluding initial condition evaluation or output handling.
Simulations are repeated four times and the minimal value is reported in order to filter
  out JIT-compilation and caching overhead and to minimise thread-schedulling differences.
For PyMPDATA runs with Numba JIT disabled, the number of repetitions is reduced from four to two.
Simulations are carried out on one, two or three threads on a machine with four physical cores.

![Comparison of wall-time measurements results for a 3D simulation using PyMPDATA with JIT disabled (red line) and enabled (connected points) corroborated against timings of analogous simulation performed with libmpdata++. Panel (a) presents scaling with the number of threads used, for the case of 16 by 16 by 16 domain. Panel (b) depicts scaling with domain size for simulations using three threads.\label{fig:perf}](fig-perf.pdf)

Figure \autoref{fig:perf} (a) depicts wall-times measured with a domain of 16 by 16 by 16, and
  for: ``PyMPDATA`` with Numba JIT disabled (red line),
  ``libmpdata++`` (green connected points), and ``PyMPDATA`` with JIT enabled for both dynamic grid
  (i.e., grid extents specified at run-time, plotted with orange connected points) and
  static grid (i.e., grid extents specified ahead of JIT compilation, blue connected points).
First, an over three orders of magnitude speedup is depicted comparing wall-times with JIT 
  disabled and enabled.
Comparison of ``PyMPDATA`` and ``libmpdata++`` reveals comparable performance and scaling with number 
  of threads with consistently shorter wall-times for ``PyMPDATA``, and a slight further improvement
  when switching from dynamic to static grid.

Figure \autoref{fig:perf} (b) depicts wall-time dependence on the domain size for the case of three threads,
  and confirms that the observed higher performance of ``PyMPDATA`` as compared with libmpdata++ can be observed 
  over a range of domain sizes starting from 16 by 16 by 16 up to 128 by 128 by 128.
While more comprehensive tests and analyses would be needed to identify the cause of this superior
  performance, two possible factors include overhead from employment of the ``Blitz++`` library in ``libmpdata++``
  as well as manual (potentially superfluous) halo-filling triggers in ``libmpdata++`` as opposed to
  automatic halo-filling design implemented in ``PyMPDATA``.
Noteworthy, as reported in @Jaruga_et_al_2015 (section 7 therein), for the very test case discussed herein,
  and for small grid sizes (59 by 59 by 59), ``libmpdata++`` had up to five times longer execution times compared 
  with the original ``FORTRAN-77`` serial implementaion of MPDATA.
This indicates that the measured performance of ``PyMPDATA`` approaches the performance of the original 
  FORTRAN-77 implementation, at the same time offering multi-threading concurrency, hiding the compilation and linking
  stages from the user, and featuring interoperability with the Python package ecosystem.
