## Dependencies and installation

To install PyMPDATA, one may use: ``pip install PyMPDATA`` (or 
``pip install git+https://github.com/open-atmos/PyMPDATA.git`` to get updates beyond the latest release).
PyMPDATA depends on ``NumPy`` and ``Numba``.

Running the tests shipped with the package requires additional packages listed in the 
[test-time-requirements.txt](https://github.com/open-atmos/PyMPDATA/blob/main/test-time-requirements.txt) file
(which include ``PyMPDATA-examples``, see below).
